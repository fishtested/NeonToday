## How it works
1. First, it displays the time and date (currently in UTC, but I may change to my local time zone)
2. 15 seconds later, it displays the weather from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) (I will change this to my coordinates)
3. 15 seconds later, it displays the time and date again
4. Repeats
